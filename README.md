# IMDB-JAVA-software
In this project I made movie software, I implemented JAVAFX, I made front end by JAVAFX and backend by mongoDB online Atlus cluster. In this too I have implemented threading concepts and CSS for making the application more stylish  ( but wrapped CSS internally as required by the project). Imade 3 clusters Primary, Secondary and tertiary, in which the write right was given to primary and rest had read right. Thus, in case if any cluster stopped working, the other cluster will be used to access the information. Only administrator have right to access primary cluste
